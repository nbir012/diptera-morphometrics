Project Definition
	
	Project Name: Geometric morphometric analysis

	Vision: To use insect wing venation to assist in the taxonomic classification of specimens

	Mission: To develop a statistical analysis of the geometry of insect wing venation to cluster insects within groups and identify outliers which may hint at new species.

	Success Criteria: 
	-Organise the data in a meaningful way
	-Analyse the landmark coordinates on an insect wing
	-The development of a working statistical analysis
	-Identify morphological range of a species
	-The automation of most of the process after the landarks have been placed

Team Agreement

	Behaviour Agreement: To communicate effectively, to treat everyone fairly, ask for feedback and take onboard comments, embrace change.

	Communication Agreement: Communicate via email when neccessary for client. Use slack for colleagues within MedSci 736.
				Meet when it canâ€™t be covered in email and have a clear scope for the meeting. Email client onoce a week regarding progress to date and any working software.
